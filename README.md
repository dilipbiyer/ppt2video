# ppt2video
This project helps create self-paced videos automatically using a images from presentation and some background audio 
Step 1: 
You run the debug file, and ensure everything you need is in order. You'd need the following to run the debug file 
 - A folder with images of the slides you want to display in the video
 - A target folder where audio will be stored and the final video will be stored
 - An excel sheet with the audio script for each slide
 - Ensure that the number of slides and number of cells in the audio scipt match.

Step 2: 
Once the debug file runs successfully, run the ppt2vid.py file. This will open a UI wth instructions on what to do. Give it enough time in the last step and your video will be ready in the choosen target folder :)
